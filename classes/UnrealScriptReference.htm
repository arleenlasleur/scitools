<p>Introduction</p>
</font><font face="Arial"><i>

<p>Purpose of this document</p>
</i></font></b><font size="2">

<p>This is a technical document describing the UnrealScript language. It&#146;s not a
tutorial, nor does it provide detailed examples of useful UnrealScript code. For examples
of UnrealScript prior to release of Unreal, the reader is referred to the source code to
the Unreal scripts, which provides tens of thousands of lines of working UnrealScript code
which solves many problems such as AI, movement, inventory, and triggers. A good way to
get started is by printing out the &quot;Actor&quot;, &quot;Object&quot;,
&quot;Pawn&quot;, &quot;Inventory&quot;, and &quot;Weapon&quot; scripts.</p>

<p>This document assumes that the reader has a working knowledge of C/C++, is familiar
with object-oriented programming, has played Unreal and has used the UnrealEd editing
environment.</p>
</font><font face="Arial"><i><b>

<p>Design goals of UnrealScript</p>
</b></i></font><font size="2">

<p>UnrealScript was created to provide the development team and the third-party Unreal
developers with a powerful, built-in programming language that maps naturally onto the
needs and nuances of game programming.</p>

<p>The major design goals of UnrealScript are: 

<ul>
  <li>To support the major concepts of time, state, properties, and networking which
    traditional programming languages don&#146;t address. This greatly simplifies UnrealScript
    code. The major complication in C/C++ based AI and game logic programming lies in dealing
    with events that take a certain amount of game time to complete, and with events which are
    dependent on aspects of the object&#146;s state. In C/C++, this results in spaghetti-code
    that is hard to write, comprehend, maintain, and debug. UnrealScript includes native
    support for time, state, and network replication which greatly simplify game programming. </li>
  <li>To provide Java-style programming simplicity, object-orientation, and compile-time error
    checking. Much as Java brings a clean programming platform to Web programmers,
    UnrealScript provides an equally clean, simple, and robust programming language to 3D
    gaming. The major programming concepts which UnrealScript derives from Java are: a
    pointerless environment with automatic garbage collection; a simple single-inheretance
    class graph; strong compile-time type checking; a safe client-side execution
    &quot;sandbox&quot;; and the familiar look and feel of C/C++/Java code. </li>
  <li>To enable rich, high level programming in terms of game objects and interactions rather
    than bits and pixels. Where design tradeoffs had to be made in UnrealScript, I sacrificed
    execution speed for development simplicity and power. After all, the low-level,
    performance-critical code in Unreal is written in C/C++ where the performance gain
    outweighs the added complexity. UnrealScript operates at a level above that, at the object
    and interaction level, rather than the bits and pixels level.</li>
</ul>

<p>During the early development of UnrealScript, several major different programming
paradigms were explored and discarded before arriving at the current incarnation. First, I
researched using the Sun and Microsoft Java VM&#146;s for Windows as the basis of
Unreal&#146;s scripting language. It turned out that Java offered no programming benefits
over C/C++ in the Unreal context, added frustraging restrictions due to the lack of needed
language features (such as operator overloading), and turned out to be unfathomably slow
due to both the overhead of the VM task switch and the inefficiencies of the Java garbage
collector in the case of a large object graph. Second, I based an early implementation of
UnrealScript on a Visual Basic variant, which worked fine, but was less friendly to
programmers accustomed to C/C++. The final decision to base UnrealScript on a C++/Java
variant was based on the desire to map game-specific concepts onto the language definition
itself, and the need for speed and familiarity. This turned out to be a good decision, as
it has greatly simplified many aspects of the Unreal codebase.</p>

<p></font><font size="2">The key elements to look at in this script are: 

<ul>
  <li>The class declaration. Each class &quot;expands&quot; (derives from) one parent class,
    and each class belongs to a &quot;package&quot;, a collection of objects that are
    distributed together. All functions and variables belong to a class, and are only
    accessible through an actor that belongs to that class. There are no system-wide global
    functions or variables. </li>
  <li>The variable declarations. UnrealScript supports a very diverse set of variable types
    including most base C/Java types, object references, structs, and arrays. In addition,
    variables can be made into editable properties which designers can access in UnrealEd
    without any programming. </li>
  <li>The functions. Functions can take a list of parameters, and they optionally return a
    value. Functions can have local variables. Some functions are called by the Unreal engine
    itself (such as BeginPlay), and some functions are called from other script code elsewhere
    (such as Trigger). </li>
  <li>The code. All of the standard C and Java keywords are supported, like &quot;for&quot;,
    &quot;while&quot;, &quot;break&quot;, &quot;switch&quot;, &quot;if&quot;, and so on.
    Braces and semicolons are used in UnrealScript as in C, C++, and Java. </li>
  <li>Actor and object references. Here you see several cases where a function is called
    within another object, using an object reference. </li>
  <li>The &quot;state&quot; keyword. This script defines several &quot;states&quot;, which are
    groupings of functions, variables, and code which are executed only when the actor is in
    that state. </li>
  <li>Note that all keywords, variable names, functions, and object names in UnrealScript are
    case-insensitive. To UnrealScript, &quot;Demon&quot;, &quot;demON&quot;, and
    &quot;demon&quot; are the same thing.</li>
</ul>
</font><font face="Arial"><i><b>

<p>The Unreal Virtual Machine</p>
</b></i></font><font size="2">

<p>The Unreal Virtual Machine consists of several components: The server, the client, the
rendering engine, and the engine support code.</p>

<p>The Unreal server controls all gameplay and interaction between players and actors. In
a single-player game, both the Unreal client and the Unreal server are run on the same
machine; in an Internet game, there is a dedicated server running on one machine; all
players connect to this machine and are clients.</p>

<p>All gameplay takes place inside a &quot;level&quot;, a self-contained environment
containing geometry and actors. Though UnrealServer may be capable of running more than
one level simultaneously, each level operates independently, and are shielded from each
other: actors cannot travel between levels, and actors on one level cannot communicate
with actors on another level.</p>

<p>Each actor in a map can either be under player control (there can be many players in a
network game) or under script control. When an actor is under script control, its script
completely defines how the actor moves and interacts with other actors.</p>

<p>With all of those actors running around, scripts executing, and events occuring in the
world, you're probably asking how one can understand the flow of execution in an
UnrealScript. The answer is as follows:</p>

<p>To manage time, Unreal divides each second of gameplay into &quot;Ticks&quot;. A tick
is the smallest unit of time in which all actors in a level are updated. A tick typically
takes between 1/100th to 1/10th of a second. The tick time is limited only by CPU power;
the faster machine, the lower the tick duration is.</p>

<p>Some commands in UnrealScript take zero ticks to execute (i.e. they execute without any
game-time passing), and others take many ticks. Functions which require game-time to pass
are called &quot;latent functions&quot;. Some examples of latent functions include
&quot;Sleep&quot;, &quot;FinishAnim&quot;, and &quot;MoveTo&quot;. Latent functions in
UnrealScript may only be called from code within a state, not from code within a function.</p>

<p>While an actor is executing a latent function, that actor's state execution doesn't
continue until the latent function completes. However, other actors, or the VM, may call
functions within the actor. The net result is that all UnrealScript functions can be
called at any time, even while latent functions are pending.</p>

<p>In traditional programming terms, UnrealScript acts as if each actor in a level has its
own &quot;thread&quot; of execution. Internally, Unreal does not use Windows threads,
because that would be very inefficient (Windows 95 and Windows NT do not handle thousands
of simultaneous threads efficiently). Instead, UnrealScript simulates threads. This fact
is transparent to UnrealScript code, but becomes very apparent when you write C++ code
which interacts with UnrealScript.</p>

<p>All UnrealScripts execute in parallel. If there are 100 monsters walking around in a
level, all 100 of those monsters' scripts are executing simultaneously and independently.</p>
</font><font face="Arial"><i><b>

<p>Class overview</p>
</b></i></font><font size="2">

<p>Before beginning work with UnrealScript, it&#146;s important to understand the
high-level relationships of objects within Unreal. The architecture of Unreal is a major
departure from that of most other games: Unreal is purely object-oriented (much like
COM/ActiveX), in that it has a well-defined object model with support for high-level
object oriented concepts such as the object graph, serialization, object lifetime, and
polymorphism. Historically, most games have been designed monolithically, with their major
functionality hardcoded and unexpandable at the object level, though many games, such as
Doom and Quake, have proven to be very expandable at the content level. There is a major
benefit to Unreal&#146;s form of object-orientation: major new functionality and object
types can be added to Unreal at runtime, and this expansion can take the form of
subclassing, rather than (for example) by modifying a bunch of existing code. This form of
extensibility is extremely powerful, as it encourages the Unreal community to create
Unreal enhancements that all interoperate.</p>
<b>

<p>Object</b> is the parent class of all objects in Unreal. All of the functions in the
Object class are accessible everywhere, because everything derives from Object. Object is
an abstract base class, in that it doesn&#146;t do anything useful. All functionality is
provided by subclasses, such as Texture (a texture map), TextBuffer (a chunk of text), and
Class (which describes the class of other objects).</p>
<b>

<p>Actor</b> (expands Object) is the parent class of all standalone game objects in
Unreal. The Actor class contains all of the functionality needed for an actor to move
around, interact with other actors, affect the environment, and do other useful
game-related things.</p>
<b>

<p>Pawn</b> (expands Actor) is the parent class of all creatures and players in Unreal
which are capable of high-level AI and player controls.</p>
<b>

<p>Class</b> (expands Object) is a special kind of object which describes a class of
object. This may seem confusing at first: a class is an object, and a class describes
certain objects. But, the concept is sound, and there are many cases where you will deal
with Class objects. For example, when you spawn a new actor in UnrealScript, you can
specify the new actor&#146;s class with a Class object.</p>

<p>With UnrealScript, you can write code for any Object class, but 99% of the time, you
will be writing code for a class derived from Actor. Most of the useful UnrealScript
functionality is game-related and deals with actors.</p>
</font><b><font face="Arial" size="4">

<p>Major elements of UnrealScript</p>
</font><font face="Arial"><i>

<p>The class declaration</p>
</i></font></b><font size="2">

<p>Each script corresponds to exactly one class, and the script begins by declaring the
class, the class&#146;s parent, and any additional information that is relevent to the
class. The simplest form is:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>class MyClass expands MyParentClass
	package(MyPackage);</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>Here I am declaring a new class named &quot;MyClass&quot;, which inherets the
functionality of &quot;MyParentClass&quot;. Additionally, the class resides in the package
named &quot;MyPackage&quot;.</p>

<p>Each class inherets all of the variables, functions, and states from its parent class.
It can then add new variable declarations, add new functions (or override the existing
functions), add new states (or add functionality to the existing states).</p>

<p>The typical approach to class design in UnrealScript is to make a new class (for
example a Minotaur monster) which expands an existing class that has most of the
functionality you need (for example the Pawn class, the base class of all monsters). With
this approach, you never need to reinvent the wheel &#150; you can simply add the new
functionality you want to customize, while keeping all of the existing functionality you
don&#146;t need to customize. This approach is especially powerful for implementing AI in
Unreal, where the built-in AI system provides a tremendous amount of base functionality
which you can use as building blocks for your custom creatures.</p>

<p>The class declaration can take several optional specifiers that affect the class:</p>
<b>

<p>Intrinsic:</b> Says &quot;this class uses behind-the-scenes C++ support&quot;. Unreal
expects Intrinsic classes to contain a C++ implementation in the DLL corresponding to the
class&#146;s package. For example, if your package is named &quot;Robots&quot;, Unreal
looks in the &quot;Robots.dll&quot; for the C++ implementation of the intrinsic class,
which is generated by the C++ IMPLEMENT_CLASS macro.</p>
<b>

<p>HideParent:</b> Says &quot;when a user is editing an object of this class in UnrealEd,
don&#146;t show any of the parent class&#146;s properties in the editor&quot;.</p>
<b>

<p>Abstract:</b> Declares the class as an &quot;abstract base class&quot;. This prevents
the user from adding actors of this class to the world in UnrealEd, because the class
isn&#146;t meaningful on its own. For example, the &quot;Pawn<br>
base class is abstract, while the &quot;Brute&quot; subclass is not abstract &#150; you
can place a Brute in the world, but you can&#146;t place a Pawn in the world.</p>
<b>

<p>Guid:</b> Associates a globally unique identifier (a 128-bit number) with the class.
This Guid is currently unused, but will be relevent when native COM support is later added
to Unreal.</p>
<b>

<p>Transient:</b> Says &quot;objects belonging to this class should never be saved on
disk&quot;. Only useful in conjunction with certain kinds of intrinsic classes which are
non-persistent by nature, such as players or windows.</p>
<b>

<p>ScriptConst:</b> Says &quot;objects of this class must be declared Const in
UnrealScript&quot;, to prevent them from being changed during gameplay.</p>
</font><font face="Arial"><i><b>

<p>Variables</p>
</b></i></font><font size="2">

<p>Here are some examples of instance variable declarations in UnrealScript:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>var int a; // Declare an integer variable named &quot;A&quot;.
var byte Table[64]; // Declare an array of 64 bytes named &quot;Table&quot;.
var string[32] PlayerName; // Declare a max 32-character string.
var actor Other; // Declare a variable referencing an actor.</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>Variables can appear in two kinds of places in UnrealScript: instance variables, which
apply to an entire object, appear immediately after the class declarations. Local
variables appear within a function, and are only active while that function executes.
Instance variables are declared with the &quot;var&quot; keyword. Local variables are
declard with the &quot;local&quot; keyword.</p>

<p>Here are the basic variable types supported in UnrealScript: 

<ul>
  <b>
  <li>byte:</b> A single-byte value ranging from 0 to 255. </li>
  <b>
  <li>int:</b> A 32-bit integer value. </li>
  <b>
  <li>bool:</b> A boolean value: either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. </li>
  <b>
  <li>float:</b> A 32-bit floating point number. </li>
  <b>
  <li>string:</b> A string of characters. </li>
  <b>
  <li>name:</b> The name of an item in Unreal (such as the name of a function, state, class,
    etc). Names are stored as a 16-bit index into the global name table. Names correspond to
    simple strings of 1-31 characters. Names are not like strings: strings can be modified
    dynamically, but names can only take on predefined name values. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Enumeration:</b> A variable that can take on one of several predefined name values. For
    example, the ELightType enumeration defined in the Actor script describes a dynamic light
    and takes on a value like LT_None, LT_Pulse, LT_Strobe, and so on. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Object and actor references:</b> A variable that refers to another object or actor in
    the world. For example, the Pawn class has an &quot;Enemy&quot; actor reference that
    specifies which actor the pawn should be trying to attack. Object and actor references are
    very powerful tools, because they enable you to access the variables and functions of
    another actor. For example, in the Pawn script, you can write
    &quot;Enemy.Damage(123)&quot; to call your enemy&#146;s Damage function &#150; resulting
    in the enemy taking damage. Object references may also contain a special value called
    &quot;None&quot;, which is the equivalent of the C &quot;NULL&quot; pointer: it says
    &quot;this variable doesn&#146;t refer to any object&quot;. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Structs:</b> Similar to C structures, UnrealScript structs let you create new variable
    types that contain sub-variables. For example, two commonly-used structs are
    &quot;vector&quot;, which consists of an X, Y, and Z component; and &quot;rotator&quot;,
    which consists of a pitch, yaw, and roll component.</li>
</ul>

<p>Variables may also contain additional specifiers such as &quot;const&quot; that further
describe the variable. Actually, there are quite a lot of specifiers which you
wouldn&#146;t expect to see in a general-purpose programming language, mainly as a result
of wanting UnrealScript to natively support many game- and environment- specific concepts:

<ul>
  <b>
  <li>const:</b> Advanced. Treats the contents of the variable as a constant. In UnrealScript,
    you can read the value of const variables, but you can&#146;t write to them.
    &quot;Const&quot; is only used for variables which the engine is responsible for updating,
    and which can&#146;t be safely updated from UnrealScript, such as an actor&#146;s Location
    (which can only be set by calling the MoveActor function). </li>
  <b>
  <li>input:</b> Advanced. Makes the variable accessible to Unreal&#146;s input system, so
    that input (such as button presses and joystick movements) can be directly mapped onto it.
    Only relevent with variables of type &quot;byte&quot; and &quot;float&quot;. </li>
  <b>
  <li>transient:</b> Advanced. Declares that the variable is for temporary use, and isn&#146;t
    part of the object&#146;s persistent state. Transient variables are not saved to disk.
    Transient variables are initialized to zero when an actor is loaded. </li>
  <b>
  <li>intrinsic:</b> Advanced. Declares that the variable is loaded and saved by C++ code,
    rather than by UnrealScript.</li>
  <li><strong>private:</strong> The variable is private, and may only be accessed by the
    class's script; no other classes (including subclasses) may access it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Arrays are declared using the following syntax:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>var int MyArray[20]; // Declares an array of 20 ints.</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>UnrealScript supports only single-dimensional arrays, though you can simulate
multidimensional arrays by carrying out the row/column math yourself.</p>

<p>In UnrealScript, you can make an instance variable &quot;editable&quot;, so that users
can edit the variable&#146;s value in UnrealEd. This mechanism is responsible for the
entire contents of the &quot;Actor Properties&quot; dialog in UnrealEd: everything you see
there is simply an UnrealScript variable, which has been declared editable.</p>

<p>The syntax for declaring an editable variable is as follows:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>var() int MyInteger; // Declare an editable integer in the default category.
var(MyCategory) bool MyBool; // Declare an editable integer in &quot;MyCategory&quot;.</small></pre>
<font face="Arial"><i><b>

<p>Object and actor reference variables</p>
</b></i></font><font size="2">

<p>You can declare a variable that refers to an actor or object like this:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>var actor A; // An actor reference.
var pawn P; // A reference to an actor in the Pawn class.
var texture T; // A reference to a texture object.</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>The variable &quot;P&quot; above is a reference to an actor in the Pawn class. Such a
variable can refer to any actor that belongs to a subclass of Pawn. For example, P might
refer to a Brute, or a Skaarj, or a Manta. It can be any kind of Pawn. However, P can
never refer to a Trigger actor (because Trigger is not a subclass of Pawn).</p>

<p>One example of where it&#146;s handy to have a variable refering to an actor is the
Enemy variable in the Pawn class, which refers to the actor which the Pawn is trying to
attack.</p>

<p>When you have a variable that refers to an actor, you can access that actor&#146;s
variables, and call its functions. For example:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>// Declare two variables that refer to a pawns.
var pawn P, Q;
&nbsp;
// Here is a function that makes use of P.
// It displays some information about P.
function MyFunction()
{
	// Set P&#146;s enemy to Q.
	P.Enemy = Q;
&nbsp;
	// Tell P to play his running animation.
	P.PlayRunning();
}</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>Variables that refer to actors always either refer to a valid actor (any actor that
actually exists in the level), or they contain the value &quot;None&quot;. None is
equivalent to the C/C++ &quot;NULL&quot; pointer. However, in UnrealScript, it is safe to
access variables and call functions with a &quot;None&quot; reference; the result is
always zero.</p>

<p>Note that an object or actor reference &quot;points to&quot; another actor or object,
it doesn&#146;t &quot;contain&quot; an actor or object. The C equivalent of an actor
reference is a pointer to an object in the AActor class (in C, you&#146;d say an </font><font
face="Courier New" size="1">AActor*</font><font size="2">). For example, you could have
two monsters in the world, Bob and Fred, who are fighting each other. Bob&#146;s
&quot;Enemy&quot; variable would &quot;point to&quot; Fred, and Fred&#146;s
&quot;Enemy&quot; variable would &quot;point to&quot; Bob.</p>

<p>Unlike C pointers, UnrealScript object references are always safe and infallible. It is
impossible for an object reference to refer to an object that doesn&#146;t exist or is
invalid (other than the special-case &quot;None&quot; value). In UnrealScript, when an
actor or object is destroyed, all references to it are automatically set to
&quot;None&quot;.</p>
</font>

<h3>Class reference variables</h3>

<p><font size="2">In Unreal, classes are objects just like actors, textures, and sounds
are objects.&nbsp; Class objects belong to the class named &quot;class&quot;.&nbsp; Now,
there will often be cases where you'll want to store a reference to a class object, so
that you can spawn an actor belonging to that class (without knowing what the class is at
compile-time).&nbsp; For example:</font></p>

<pre><font size="3">var() class C;
var actor A;
A = Spawn( C ); // Spawn an actor belonging to some arbitrary class C.</font></pre>

<p><font size="2">Now, be sure not to confuse the roles of a class C, and an object O
belonging to class C.&nbsp; To give a really shaky analogy, a class is like a pepper
grinder, and an object is like pepper.&nbsp; You can use the pepper grinder (the class) to
create pepper (objects of that class) by turning the crank (calling the Spawn
function)...BUT, a pepper grinder (a class) is <em><strong>not</strong></em> pepper (an
object belonging to the class), so you MUST NOT TRY TO EAT IT!</font></p>

<p><font size="2">When declaring variables that reference class objects, you can
optionally use the special class&lt;classlimitor&gt; syntax to limit the variable to only
containing references to classes which expand a given superclass.&nbsp; For example, in
the declaration:</font></p>

<pre><font size="3">var class&lt;actor&gt; ActorClass;</font></pre>

<p><font size="2">The variable ActorClass may only reference a class that expands the
&quot;actor&quot; class.&nbsp; This is useful for improving compile-time type checking.
&nbsp; For example, the Spawn function takes a class as a parameter, but only makes sense
when the given class is a subclass of Actor, and the class&lt;classlimitor&gt; syntax
causes the compiler to enforce that requirement.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">As with dynamic object casting, you can dynamically cast classes like
this:</font></p>

<pre><font size="3">class&lt;actor&gt;( SomeFunctionCall() )</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial"><i><b><i><b>Enumerations</b></i></b></i></font></p>
<font size="2">

<p>Enumerations exist in UnrealScript as a convenient way to declare variables that can
contain &quot;one of&quot; a bunch of keywords. For example, the actor class contains the
enumeration EPhysics which describes the physics which Unreal should apply to the actor.
This can be set to one of the predefined values like PHYS_None, PHYS_Walking,
PHYS_Falling, and so on.</p>

<p>Internally, enumerations are stored as byte variables. In designing UnrealScript,
enumerations were not seen as a necessity, but it makes code so much easier to read to see
that an actor&#146;s physics mode is being set to &quot;PHYS_Swimming&quot; than (for
example) &quot;3&quot;.</p>

<p>Here is sample code that declares enumerations.</p>
</font>

<pre><small>// Declare the EColor enumeration, with three values.
enum EColor
{
	CO_Red,
	CO_Green,
	CO_Blue
};
&nbsp;
// Now, declare two variables of type EColor.
var EColor ShirtColor, HatColor;
&nbsp;
// Alternatively, you can declare variables and
// enumerations together like this:
var enum EFruit
{
	FRUIT_Apple,
	FRUIT_Orange,
	FRUIT_Bannana
} FirstFruit, SecondFruit;</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>In the Unreal source, we always declare enumeration values like LT_Steady,
PHYS_Falling, and so on, rather than as simply &quot;Steady&quot; or &quot;Falling&quot;.
This is just a matter of programming style, and is not a requirement of the language.</p>
</font>

<p><font size="2">UnrealScript only recognizes unqualified enum tags (like FRUIT_Apple) in
classes where the enumeration was defined, and in its subclasses.&nbsp; If you need to
refer to an enumeration tag defined somewhere else in the class hierarchy, you must
&quot;qualify it&quot;:</font></p>

<pre><small>FRUIT_Apple // If Unreal can't find this enum tag...
EFruit.FRUIT_Apple // Then qualify it like this.</small></pre>
<font face="Arial"><i><b>

<p>Structs</p>
</b></i></font><font size="2">

<p>An UnrealScript struct is a way of cramming a bunch of variables together into a new
kind of super-variable called a struct. UnrealScript structs are just like C structs, in
that they can contain any simple variables or arrays.</p>

<p>You can declare a struct as follows:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>// A point or direction vector in 3D space.
struct Vector
{
	var float X;
	var float Y;
	var float Z
};</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>Once you declare a struct, you are ready to start declaring specific variables of that
struct type:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>// Declare a bunch of variables of type Vector.
var Vector Position;
var Vector Destination;</small></pre>

<p>To access a component of a struct, use code like the following.</p>

<pre><small>function MyFunction()
{
	Local Vector A, B, C;
	&nbsp;
	// Add some vectors.
	C = A + B;
&nbsp;
	// Add just the x components of the vectors.
	C.X = A.X + B.X;
&nbsp;
	// Pass vector C to a function.
	SomeFunction( C );
&nbsp;
	// Pass certain vector components to a function.
	OtherFunction( A.X, C.Z );
}</small>&nbsp;</pre>
<font size="2">

<p>You can do anything with Struct variables that you can do with other variables: you can
assign variables to them, you can pass them to functions, and you can access their
components.</p>

<p>There are several Structs defined in the Object class which are used throughout Unreal.
You should become familiar with their operation, as they are fundamental building blocks
of scripts: 

<ul>
  <b>
  <li>Vector:</b> A unique 3D point or vector in space, with an X, Y, and Z component. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Plane:</b> Defines a unique plane in 3D space. A plane is defined by its X, Y, and Z
    components (which are assumed to be normalized) plus its W component, which represents the
    distance of the plane from the origin, along the plane&#146;s normal (which is the
    shortest line from the plane to the origin). </li>
  <b>
  <li>Rotation:</b> A rotation defining a unique orthogonal coordinate system. A rotation
    contains Pitch, Yaw, and Roll components. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Coords:</b> An arbitrary coordinate system in 3D space. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Color:</b> An RGB color value. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Region:</b> Defines a unique convex region within a level.</li>
</ul>
</font><font face="Arial"><i><b>

<p>Functions</p>
</b></i></font><font size="2">

<p>In UnrealScript, you can declare new functions and write new versions of existing
functions. Functions can take one or more parameters (of any variable type UnrealScript
supports), and can optionally return a value. Though most functions are written directly
in UnrealScript, you can also declare functions that can be called from UnrealScript, but
which are implemented in C++ and reside in a DLL. The Unreal technology supports all
possible combinations of function calling: The C++ engine can call script functions;
script can call C++ functions; and script can call script.</p>

<p>Here is a simple function declaration. This function takes a vector as a parameter, and
returns a floating point number:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>// Function to compute the size of a vector.
function float VectorSize( vector V )
{
	return sqrt( V.X * V.X + V.Y * V.Y + V.Z * V.Z );
}</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>The word &quot;function&quot; always precedes a function declaration. It is followed by
the optional return type of the function (in this case, &quot;float&quot;), then the
function name, and then the list of function parameters enclosed in parenthesis.</p>

<p>When a function is called, the code within the brackets is executed. Inside the
function, you can declare local variables (using the &quot;local&quot; keyword&quot;), and
execute any UnrealScript code. The optional &quot;return&quot; keyword causes the function
to immediately return a value.</p>

<p>You can pass any UnrealScript types to a function (including arrays), and a function
can return any type.</p>

<p>By default, any local variables you declare in a function are initialized to zero.</p>

<p>Function calls can be recursive. For example, the following function computes the
factorial of a number:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>// Function to compute the factorial of a number.
function int Factorial( int Number )
{
	if( Number &lt;= 0 )
		return 1;
	else
		return Number * Factorial( Number &#150; 1 );
}</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>Some UnrealScript functions are called by the engine whenever certain events occur. For
example, when an actor is touched by another actor, the engine calls its &quot;Touch&quot;
function to tell it who is touching it. By writing a custom &quot;Touch&quot; function,
you can take special actions as a result of the touch occuring:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>// Called when something touches this actor.
function Touch( actor Other )
{
	Log( &quot;I was touched!&quot;)
	Other.Message( &quot;You touched me!&quot; );
}</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>The above function illustrates several things. First of all, the function writes a
message to the log file using the &quot;Log&quot; command (which is the equivalent of
Basic&#146;s &quot;print&quot; command and C&#146;s &quot;printf&quot;). Second, it calls
the &quot;Message&quot; function residing in the actor Other. Calling functions in other
actors is a common action in UnrealScript, and in object-oriented languages like Java in
general, because it provides a simple means for actors to communicate with each other.</p>
</font><font face="Arial"><i><b>

<p>Function parameter specifiers</p>
</b></i></font><font size="2">

<p>When you normally call a function, UnrealScript makes a local copy of the parameters
you pass the function. If the function modifies some of the parameters, those don&#146;t
have any effect on the variables you passed in. For example, the following program:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>function int DoSomething( int x )
{
	x = x * 2;
	return x;
}
function int DoSomethingElse()
{
	local int a, b;
&nbsp;
	a = 2;
	log( &quot;The value of a is &quot; $ a );
&nbsp;
	b = DoSomething( a );
	log( &quot;The value of a is &quot; $ a );
	log( &quot;The value of b is &quot; $ b );
}</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>Produces the following output when DoSomethingElse is called:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>The value of a is 2
The value of a is 2
The value of b is 4</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>In other words, the function DoSomething was futzing with a local copy of the variable
&quot;a&quot; which was passed to it, and it was not affecting the real variable
&quot;a&quot;.</p>

<p>The &quot;out&quot; specified lets you tell a function that it should actually modify
the variable that is passed to it, rather than making a local copy. This is useful, for
example, if you have a function that needs to return several values to the caller. You can
juse have the caller pass several variables to the function which are &quot;out&quot;
values. For example:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>// Compute the minimum and maximum components of a vector.
function VectorRange( vector V, out float Min, out float Max )
{
	// Compute the minimum value.
	if ( V.X&lt;V.Y &amp;&amp; V.X&lt;V.Z ) Min = V.X;
	else if( V.Y&lt;V.Z ) Min = V.Y;
	else Min = V.Z;
&nbsp;
	// Compute the maximum value.
	if ( V.X&gt;V.Y &amp;&amp; V.X&gt;V.Z ) Max = V.X;
	else if( V.Y&gt;V.Z ) Max = V.Y;
	else Max = V.Z;
}</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>Without the &quot;out&quot; keyword, it would be painful to try to write functions that
had to return more than one value.</p>

<p>With the &quot;optional&quot; keyword, you can make certain function parameters
optional, as a convenience to the caller. For UnrealScript functions, optional parameters
which the caller doesn&#146;t specify are set to zero. For intrinsic functions, the
default values of optional parameters depends on the function. For example, the Spawn
function takes an optional location and rotation, which default to the spawning
actor&#146;s location and rotation.</p>

<p>The &quot;coerce&quot; keyword forces the caller&#146;s parameters to be converted to
the specified type (even if UnrealScript normally would not perform the conversion
automatically). This is useful for functions that deal with strings, so that the
parameters are automatically converted to strings for you.</p>
</font><font face="Arial"><i><b>

<p>Function overriding</p>
</b></i></font><font size="2">

<p>&quot;Function overriding&quot; refers to writing a new version of a function in a
subclass. For example, say you&#146;re writing a script for a new kind of monster called a
Demon. The Demon class, which you just created, expands the Pawn class. Now, when a pawn
sees a player for the first time, the pawn&#146;s &quot;SeePlayer&quot; function is
called, so that the </font><font size="1">pawn</font><font size="2"> can start attacking
the player. This is a nice concept, but say you wanted to handle &quot;SeePlayer&quot;
differently in your new Demon class. How do you do this? Function overriding is the
answer.</p>

<p>To override a function, just cut and paste the function definition from the parent
class into your new class. For example, for SeePlayer, you could add this to your Demon
class.</p>
</font>

<pre><small>// New Demon class version of the Touch function.
function SeePlayer( actor SeenPlayer )
{
	log( &quot;The demon saw a player&quot; );
	// Add new custom functionality here&#133;
}</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>Function overriding is the key to creating new UnrealScript classes efficiently. You
can create a new class that expands on an existing class. Then, all you need to do is
override the functions which you want to be handled differently. This enables you to
create new kinds of objects without writing gigantic amounts of code.</p>

<p>Several functions in UnrealScript are declared as &quot;final&quot;. The
&quot;final&quot; keyword (which appears immediately before the word &quot;function&quot;)
says &quot;this function cannot be overridden by child classes&quot;. This should be used
in functions which you know nobody would want to override, because it results in faster
script code. For example, say you have a &quot;VectorSize&quot; function that computes the
size of a vector. There&#146;s absolutely no reason anyone would ever override that, so
declare it as &quot;final&quot;. On the other hand, a function like &quot;Touch&quot; is
very context-dependent and should not be final.</p>
</font><b><font face="Arial"><i>

<p>Advanced function specifiers</p>
</i></font><font size="2">

<p>Static: </b>A static function acts like a C global function, in that it can be called
without having a reference to an object of the class.&nbsp; Static functions can call
other static functions, and can access the default values of variables.&nbsp; Static
functions cannot call non-static functions and they cannot access instance variables
(since they are not executed with respect to an instance of an object).&nbsp; Unlike
languages like C++, static functions are virtual and can be overridden in child classes.
&nbsp; This is useful in cases where you wish to call a static function in a variable
class (a class not known at compile time, but referred to by a variable or an expression).</p>

<p><b>Singular: </b>The &quot;singular&quot; keyword, which appears immediately before a
function declaration, prevents a function from calling itself recursively. The rule is
this: If a certain actor is already in the middle of a singular function, any subsequent
calls to singular functions will be skipped over. This is useful in avoiding
infinite-recursive bugs in some cases. For example, if you try to move an actor inside of
your &quot;Bump&quot; function, there is a good chance that the actor will bump into
another actor during its move, resulting in another call to the &quot;Bump&quot; function,
and so on. You should be very careful in avoiding such behaviour, but if you can&#146;t
write code with complete confidence that you&#146;re avoiding such potential recursive
situations, use the &quot;singular&quot; keyword.</p>
<b>

<p>Intrinsic: </b>You can declare UnrealScript functions as &quot;intrinsic&quot;, which
means that the function is callable from UnrealScript, but is actually written (elsewhere)
in C++. For example, the Actor class contains a lot of intrinsic function definitions,
such as:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>intrinsic(266) final function bool Move( vector Delta );</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>The number inside the parenthesis after the &quot;intrinsic&quot; keyword corresponds
to the number of the function as it was declared in C++ (using the AUTOREGISTER_INTRINSIC
macro). The intrinsic function is expected to reside in the DLL named identically to the
package of the class containing the UnrealScript definition.</p>
<b>

<p>Latent:</b> Declares that an intrinsic function is latent, meaning that it can only be
called from state code, and it may return after some game-time has passed.</p>
<b>

<p>Iterator:</b> Declares that an intrinsic function is an iterator, which can be used to
loop through a list of actors using the &quot;foreach&quot; command.</p>
<b>

<p>Simulated:</b> Declares that a function may execute on the client-side when an actor is
either a simulated proxy or an autonomous proxy. All functions that are both intrinsic and
final are automatically simulated as well.</p>
<b>

<p>Operator</b>, <b>PreOperator</b>, <b>PostOperator</b>: These keywords are for declaring
a special kind of function called an operator (equivalent to C++ operators). This is how
UnrealScript knows about all of the built-in operators like &quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot;,
&quot;==&quot;, and &quot;||&quot;. I'm not going into detail on how operators work in
this document, but the concept of operators is similar to C++, and you can declare new
operator functions and keywords as UnrealScript functions or intrinsic functions.</p>
</font>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Event</strong>:</font><font size="1"> </font><small>The
&quot;event&quot; keyword has the same meaning to UnrealScript as &quot;function&quot;.
However, when you export a C++ header file from Unreal using &quot;unreal -make -h&quot;,
UnrealEd automatically generates a C++ -&gt; UnrealScript calling stub for each
&quot;event&quot;.&nbsp; This is a much cleaner replacement for the old
&quot;PMessageParms&quot; struct, because it automatically keeps C++ code synched up with
UnrealScript functions and eliminates the possibility of passing invalid parameters to an
UnrealScript function. For example, this bit of UnrealScript code:</small></p>

<pre><small>event Touch( Actor Other )
{ ... }</small></pre>

<p>Generates this piece of code in EngineClasses.h:</p>

<pre><small>void Touch(class AActor* Other)
{
    FName N(&quot;Touch&quot;,FNAME_Intrinsic);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;struct {class AActor* Other; } Parms;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parms.Other=Other;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ProcessEvent(N,&amp;Parms);
}</small></pre>

<p>Thus enabling you to call the UnrealScript function from C++ like this:</p>

<pre><small>AActor *SomeActor, *OtherActor;
Actor-&gt;Touch(OtherActor);</small></pre>
<font face="Arial"><i><b>

<p>Flow control</p>
</b></i></font><font size="2">

<p>UnrealScript supports all the standard flow-control statements of C/C++/Java: 

<ul>
  <li>&quot;For&quot; loops let you cycle through a loop as long as some condition is met. For
    example:</li>
</ul>
</font>

<pre><small>// Example of &quot;for&quot; loop.
function ForExample()
{
	local int i;
	log( &quot;Demonstrating the for loop&quot; );
	for( i=0; i&lt;4; i++ )
	{
		log( &quot;The value of i is &quot; $ i );

The value of i is 2
The value of i is 3
Completed with i=4</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>In a for loop, you must specify three expressions separated by semicolons. The first
expression is for initializing a variable to its starting value. The second expression
gives a condition which is checked before each iteration of the loop executes; if this
expression is true, the loop executes. If it&#146;s false, the loop terminates. The third
condition gives an expression which increments the loop counter.</p>

<p>Though most &quot;for&quot; loop expressions just update a counter, you can also use
&quot;for&quot; loops for more advanced things like traversing linked lists, by using the
appropriate initialization, termination, and increment expressions.</p>

<p>In all of the flow control statements, you can either execute a single statement,
without brackets, as follows:</p>

<pre><small>for( i=0; i&lt;4; i++ )
	log( &quot;The value of i is &quot; $ i );</small></pre>

<p>A &quot;switch&quot; statement consists of one or more &quot;case&quot; statements, and
an optional &quot;default&quot; statement. After a switch statement, execution goes to the

&quot;default&quot; statement; otherwise execution continues past the end of the
&quot;select&quot; statement.</p>

<p>After you write code following a &quot;case&quot; label, you must use a
&quot;break&quot; statement to cause execution to go past the end of the

&quot;falls through&quot; to the next &quot;case&quot; handler.</p>

<p>States</p>
</b></i></font><font size="2">

<p>Historically, game programmers have been using the concept of states ever since games
evolved past the &quot;pong&quot; phase. States (and what is known as &quot;state machine
programming&quot;) are a natural way of making complex object behaviour manageable.
However, before UnrealScript, states have not been supported at the language level,
requiring developers to create C/C++ &quot;switch&quot; statements based on the
object&#146;s state. Such code was difficult to write and update.</p>

<p>UnrealScript supports states at the language level.</p>

<p>In UnrealScript, each actor in the world is always in one and only one state. Its state
reflects the action it wants to perform. For example, moving brushes have several states
like &quot;StandOpenTimed&quot; and &quot;BumpOpenTimed&quot;. Pawns have several states
such as &quot;Dying&quot;, &quot;Attacking&quot;, and &quot;Wandering&quot;.</p>

<p>In UnrealScript, you can write functions and code which exist in a particular state.
These functions are only called when the actor is in that state. For example, say
you&#146;re writing a monster script, and you&#146;re contemplating how to handle the
&quot;SeePlayer&quot; function. When you&#146;re wandering around, you want to attack the
player you see. When you&#146;re already attacking the player, you want to continue on
uninterrupted.</p>

<p>The easiest way to do this is by defining several states (Wandering and Attacking), and
writing a different version of &quot;Touch&quot; in each state. UnrealScript supports
this.</p>

<p>Before delving deeper into states, you need to understand that there are two major
benefits to states, and one complication: 

<ul>
  <li>Benefit: States provide a simple way to write state-specific functions, so that you can
    handle the same function in different ways, depending on what the actor is doing. </li>
  <li>Benefit: With a state, you can write special &quot;state code&quot;, using all of the
    regular UnrealScript commands plus several special functions known as &quot;latent
    functions&quot;. A latent function is a function which executes &quot;slowly&quot;, and
    may return after a certain amount of &quot;game time&quot; has passed. This enables you to
    perform time-based programming &#150; a major benefit which neither C, C++, nor Java
    offer. Namely, you can write code in the same way you conceptualize it; for example, you
    can write a script that says the equivalent of &quot;open this door; pause 2 seconds; play
    this sound effect; open that door; release that monster and have it attack the
    player&quot;. You can do this with simple, linear code, and the Unreal engine takes care
    of the details of managing the time-based execution of the code. </li>
  <li>Complication: Now that you can have functions (like &quot;Touch&quot;) overridden in
    multiple states as well as in child classes, you have the burden of figuring out exactly
    which &quot;Touch&quot; function is going to be called in a specific situation.
    UnrealScript provides rules which clearly delineate this process, but it is something you
    must be aware of if you create complex hierarchies of classes and states.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an example of states from the TriggerLight script:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>// Trigger turns the light on.
state() TriggerTurnsOn
{
	function Trigger( actor Other, pawn EventInstigator )
	{
		Trigger = None;
		Direction = 1.0;
		Enable( 'Tick' );
	}
}
&nbsp;
// Trigger turns the light off.
state() TriggerTurnsOff
{
	function Trigger( actor Other, pawn EventInstigator )
	{
		Trigger = None;
		Direction = -1.0;
		Enable( 'Tick' );
	}
}</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>Here you are declaring two different states (TriggerTurnsOn and TriggerTurnsOff), and
you&#146;re writing a different version of the Trigger function in each state. Though you
could pull off this implementation without states, using states makes the code far more
modular and expandable: in UnrealScript, you can easily subclass an existing class, add
new states, and add new functions. If you had tried to do this without states, the
resulting code would be more difficult to expand later.</p>

<p>A state can be declared as editable, meaning that the user can set an actor&#146;s
state in UnrealEd, or not. To declare an editable state, do the following:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>state() MyState
{
	//...
}</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>To declare a non-editable state, do this:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>state MyState
{
	//...
}</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>You can also specify the automatic, or initial state that an actor should be in by
using the &quot;auto&quot; keyword. This causes all new actors to be placed in that state
when they first are activated:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>auto state MyState
{
	//...
}</small></pre>
<font face="Arial"><i><b>

<p>State code</p>
</b></i></font><font size="2">

<p>In addition to functions, a state can contain one or more labels followed by
UnrealScript code. For example:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>auto state MyState
{
Begin:
	Log( &quot;MyState has just begun!&quot; );
	Sleep( 2.0 );
	Log( &quot;MyState has finished sleeping&quot; );</small>
<small>	goto Begin;
}</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>The above state code prints the message &quot;MyState has just begun!&quot;, then it
pauses for two seconds, then it prints the message &quot;MyState has finished
sleeping&quot;. The interesting thing in this example is the call to the latent function
&quot;Sleep&quot;: this function call doesn&#146;t return immediately, but returns after a
certain amount of game time has passed. Latent functions can only be called from within
state code, and not from within functions. Latent functions let you manage complex chains
of events which include the passage of time.</p>

<p>All state code begins with a label definition; in the above example the label is named
&quot;Begin&quot;. The label provides a convenient entry point into the state code. You
can use any label name in state code, but the &quot;Begin&quot; label is special: it is
the default starting point for code in that state. </p>

<p>There are three main latent functions available to all actors: 

<ul>
  <b>
  <li>Sleep( float Seconds )</b> pauses the state execution for a certain amount of time, and
    then continues. </li>
  <b>
  <li>FinishAnim()</b> waits until the current animation sequence you&#146;re playing
    completes, and then continues. This function makes it easy to write animation-driven
    scripts, scripts whose execution is governed by mesh animations. For example, most of the
    AI scripts are animation-driven (as opposed to time-driven), because smooth animation is a
    key goal of the AI system. </li>
  <b>
  <li>FinishInterpolation()</b> waits for the current InterpolationPoint movement to complete,
    and then continues.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Pawn class defines several important latent functions for actions such as
navigating through the world and short-term movement. See the separate AI docs for
descriptions of their usage.</p>

<p>Three intrinsic UnrealScript functions are particularly useful when writing state code:

<ul>
  <li>The &quot;Goto&quot; function (similar to the C/C++/Basic goto) within a state causes
    the state code to continue executing at a different label. </li>
  <li>The special Goto('') command within a state causes the state code execution to stop.
    State code execution doesn&#146;t continue until you go to a new state, or go to a new
    label within the current state. </li>
  <li>The &quot;GotoState&quot; function causes the actor to go to a new state, and optionally
    continue at a specified label (if you don&#146;t specify a label, the default is the
    &quot;Begin&quot; label). You can call GotoState from within state code, and it goes to
    the destination immediately. You can also call GotoState from within any function in the
    actor, but that does not take effect immediately: it doesn&#146;t take effect until
    execution returns back to the state code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an example of the state concepts discussed so far:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>// This is the automatic state to execute.
auto state Idle
{
	// When touched by another actor&#133;
	function Touch( actor Other )
	{
		log( &quot;I was touched, so I&#146;m going to Attacking&quot; );
		GotoState( &#145;Attacking&#146; );
		Log( &quot;I have gone to the Attacking state&quot; );
	}
Begin:
	log( &quot;I am idle&#133;&quot; );
	sleep( 10 );
	goto &#145;Begin&#146;;
}
&nbsp;
// Attacking state.
state Attacking
{
Begin:
	Log( &quot;I am executing the attacking state code&quot; );
	//...
}</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>When you run this program and then go touch the actor, you will see:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>I am idle&#133;
I am idle&#133;
I am idle&#133;
I was touched, so I&#146;m going to Attacking
I have gone to the Attacking state
I am executing the attacking state code</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>Make sure you understand this important aspect of GotoState: When you call GotoState
from within a function, it does not go to the destination immediately, rather it goes
there once execution returns back to the state code.</p>
</font><font face="Arial"><i><b>

<p>State inheretance and scoping rules</p>
</b></i></font><font size="2">

<p>In UnrealScript, when you subclass an existing class, your new class inherets all of
the variables, functions and states from its parent class. This is well-understood.</p>

<p>However, the addition of the state abstraction to the UnrealScript programming model
adds additional twists to the inheretance and scoping rules. The complete inheretance
rules are: 

<ul>
  <li>A new class inherets all of the variables from its parent class. </li>
  <li>A new class inherents all of its parent class&#146;s non-state functions. You can
    override any of those inhereted non-state functions. You can add entirely new non-state
    functions. </li>
  <li>A new class inherets all of its parent class&#146;s states, including the functions and
    labels within those states. You can override any of the inhereted state functions, and you
    can override any of the inhereted state labels, you can add new state functions, and you
    can add new state labels.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an example of all the overriding rules:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>// Here is an example parent class.
class MyParentClass expands Actor
	package(MyPackage);
&nbsp;
// A non-state function.
function MyInstanceFunction()
{
	log( &quot;Executing MyInstanceFunction&quot; );
}
&nbsp;
// A state.
state MyState
{
	// A state function.
	function MyStateFunction()
	{
		Log( &quot;Executing MyStateFunction&quot; );
	}
// The &quot;Begin&quot; label.
Begin:
	Log(&quot;Beginning MyState&quot;);
}
&nbsp;
// Here is an example child class.
class MyChildClass expands MyParentClass
	package(MyPackage);
&nbsp;
// Here I&#146;m overriding a non-state function.
function MyInstanceFunction()
{
	Log( &quot;Executing MyInstanceFunction in child class&quot; );
}
&nbsp;
// Here I&#146;m redeclaring MyState so that I can override MyStateFunction.
state MyState
{
	// Here I&#146;m overriding MyStateFunction.
	function MyStateFunction()
	{
		Log( &quot;Executing MyStateFunction&quot; );
	}
// Here I&#146;m overriding the &quot;Begin&quot; label.
Begin:
	Log( &quot;Beginning MyState in MyChildClass&quot; );
}</small></pre>
<font size="1">

<p></font><font size="2">When you have a function that is implemented globally, in one or
more states, and in one or more parent classes, you need to understand which version of
the function will be called in a given context. The scoping rules, which resolves these
complex situations, are: 

<ul>
  <li>If the actor is in a state, and an implementation of the function exists somewhere in
    that state (either in the actor&#146;s class or in some parent class), the most-derived
    state version of the function is called. </li>
  <li>Otherwise, the most-derived non-state version of the function is called.</li>
</ul>

<p>In complex programming situations, you will often need to call a specific version of a
function, rather than the one that&#146;s in the current scope. To deal with these cases,
UnrealScript provides the following keywords: 

<ul>
  <b>
  <li>Global</b>: Calls the most-derived global (non-state) version of the function. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Super:</b> Calls the corresponding version of the function in the parent class. The
    function called may either be a state or non-state function depending on context. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Super(classname):</b> Calls the corresponding version of the function residing in (or
    above) the specified class. The function called may either be a state or non-state
    function depending on context.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not valid to combine multiple calling specifiers (i.e.
Super(Actor).Global.Touch).</p>

<p>Here are some examples of calling specifiers:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>class MyClass expands Pawn
	package(MyPackage);
&nbsp;
function MyExample( actor Other )
{
	Super(Pawn).Touch( Other );
	Global.Touch( Other );
	Super.Touch( Other );
}</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>As an additional example, the BeginPlay() function is called when an actor is about to
enter into gameplay. The BeginPlay() function is implemented in the Actor class and it
contains some important functionality that needs to be executed. Now, say you want to
override BeginPlay() in your new class MyClass, to add some new functionality. To do that
safely, you need to call the version of BeginPlay() in the parent class:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>class MyClass expands Pawn
	package(MyPackage);
&nbsp;
function BeginPlay()
{
	// Call the version of BeginPlay in the parent class (important).
	Super.BeginPlay();
&nbsp;
	// Now do custom BeginPlay stuff.
	//...
}</small></pre>
<font face="Arial"><i><b>

<p>Advanced state programming</p>
</b></i></font><font size="2">

<p>If a state doesn&#146;t override a state of the same name in the parent class, then you
can optionally use the &quot;expands&quot; keyword to make the state expand on an existing
state in the current class. This is useful, for example, in a situatio where you have a
group of similar states (such as MeleeAttacking and RangeAttacking) which have a lot of
functionality in common. In this case you could declare a base Attacking state as follows:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>// Base Attacking state.
state Attacking
{
	// Stick base functions here...
} 
&nbsp;
// Attacking up-close.
state MeleeAttacking expands Attacking
{
	// Stick specialized functions here...
} 
&nbsp;
// Attacking from a distance.
state RangeAttacking expands Attacking
{
	// Stick specialized functions here...
} </small></pre>

<p><small>A state can optionally use the &quot;ignores&quot; specifier to ignore functions
while in a state. The syntax for this is:</small></p>

<pre><small>// Declare a state.
state Retreating
{
	// Ignore the following messages...
	ignores Touch, UnTouch, MyFunction;
&nbsp;
	// Stick functions here...
}</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>You can tell what specific state an actor is in from its &quot;state&quot; variable, a
variable of type &quot;name&quot;.</p>

<p>It is possible for an actor to be in &quot;no state&quot; by using
GotoState(&#145;&#146;). When an actor is in &quot;no state&quot;, only its global
(non-state) functions are called.</p>

<p>Whever you use the GotoState command to set an actor&#146;s state, the engine can call
two special notification functions, if you have defined them: EndState() and BeginState().
EndState is called in the current state immediately before the new state is begun, and
BeginState is called immediately after the new state begins. These functions provide a
convenient place to do any state-specific initialization and cleanup which your state may
require.</p>
</font><font face="Arial"><i><b>

<p>Constants</p>
</b></i></font><font size="2">

<p>In UnrealScript, you can specify constant values of nearly all data types: 

<ul>
  <li>Integer and byte constants are specified with simple numbers, for example: 123 </li>
  <li>If you must specify an integer or byte constant in hexidecimal format, use i.e.: 0x123 </li>
  <li>Floating point constants are specified with decimal numbers like: 456.789 </li>
  <li>String constants must be enclosed in double quotes, for example: &quot;MyString&quot; </li>
  <li>Name constants must be enclosed in single quotes, for example &#145;MyName&#146; </li>
  <li>Vector constants contain X, Y, and Z values like this: Vect(1.0,2.0,4.0) </li>
  <li>Rotation constants contant Pitch, Yaw, and Roll values like this: Rot(0x8000,0x4000,0) </li>
  <li>The &quot;None&quot; constant refers to &quot;no object&quot; (or equivalantly, &quot;no
    actor&quot;). </li>
  <li>The &quot;Self&quot; constant refers to &quot;this object&quot; (or equivalantly,
    &quot;this actor&quot;), i.e. the object whose script is executing. </li>
  <li>General object constants are specified by the object type followed by the object name in
    single quotes, for example: texture &#145;Default&#146; </li>
  <li>EnumCount gives you the number of elements in an enumeration, for example:
    EnumCount(ELightType) </li>
  <li>ArrayCount gives you the number of elements in an array, for example:
    ArrayCount(Touching)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use the &quot;const&quot; keyword to declare constants which you can later
refer to by name.&nbsp; For example:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>const LargeNumber=123456;
const PI=3.14159;
const MyName=&quot;Tim&quot;;
const Northeast=Vect(1.0,1.0,0.0);</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>Constants can be defined within classes or within structs.</p>
</font>

<p><font size="2">To access a constant which was declared in another class, use the
&quot;classname.constname&quot; syntax, for example:</font></p>

<pre><small>Pawn.LargeNumber</small></pre>
<font face="Arial"><i><b>

<p>Expressions</p>
</b></i></font><font size="2">

<p>To assign a value to a variable, use &quot;=&quot; like this:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>function Test()
{
	local int i;
	local string[80] s;
	local vector v, q;
&nbsp;
	i = 10; // Assign a value to integer variable i.
	s = &quot;Hello!&quot;; // Assign a value to string variable s.
	v = q; // Copy value of vector q to v.
}</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>In UnrealScript, whenever a function or other expression requires a certain type of
data (for example, an &quot;float&quot;), and you specify a different type of data (for
example, an &quot;int), the compiler will try to convert the value you give to the proper
type. Conversions among all the numerical data types (byte, int, and float) happen
automatically, without any work on your part.</p>

<p>UnrealScript is also able to many other built-in data types to other types, if you
explicitly convert them in code. The syntax for this is:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>function Test()
{
	local int i;
	local string[80] s;
	local vector v, q;
	local rotation r;
&nbsp;
	s = string(i); // Convert integer i to a string, and assign it to s.
	s = string(v); // Convert vector v to a string, and assign it to s.
	v = q + vector(r); // Convert rotation r to a vector, and add q.
}</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>Here is the complete set of non-automatic conversions you can use in UnrealScript: 

<ul>
  <b>
  <li>String to Byte, Int, Float:</b> Tries to convert a string like &quot;123&quot; to a
    value like 123. If the string doesn&#146;t represent a value, the result is 0. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Byte, Int, Float, Vector, Rotation to String:</b> Converts the number to its textual
    representation. </li>
  <b>
  <li>String to Vector, Rotation:</b> Tries to parse the vector or rotation&#146;s textual
    representation. </li>
  <b>
  <li>String to Bool:</b> Converts the case-insensitive words &quot;True&quot; or
    &quot;False&quot; to True and False; converts any non-zero value to True; everything else
    is False. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Bool to String:</b> Result is either &quot;True&quot; or &quot;False&quot;. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Byte, Int, Float, Vector, Rotation to Bool:</b> Converts nonzero values to True; zero
    values to False. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Bool to Byte, Int, Float:</b> Converts True to 1; False to 0. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Name to String:</b> Converts the name to the text equivalant. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Rotation to Vector:</b> Returns a vector facing &quot;forward&quot; according to the
    rotation. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Vector to Rotation:</b> Returns a rotation pitching and yawing in the direction of the
    vector; roll is zero. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Object (or Actor) to Int:</b> Returns an integer that is guaranteed unique for that
    object. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Object (or Actor) to Bool:</b> Returns False if the object is None; False otherwise. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Object (or Actor) to String:</b> Returns a textual representation of the object.</li>
</ul>
</font><font face="Arial"><i><b>

<p>Converting among Actor and Object classes</p>
</b></i></font><font size="2">

<p>Just like the conversion functions above, which convert among simple datatypes, in
UnrealScript you can convert actor and object references among various types. For example,
all actors have a variable named &quot;Target&quot;, which is a reference to another
actor. Say you are writing a script where you need to check and see if your Target belongs
to the &quot;Pawn&quot; actor class, and you need to do something special with your target
that only makes sense when it&#146;s a pawn -- for example, you need to call one of the
Pawn functions. The actor cast operators let you do this. Here&#146;s an example:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>var actor Target;
//...
&nbsp;
function TestActorConversions()
{
	local Pawn P;
&nbsp;
	// See if my target is a Pawn.
	P = Pawn(Target);
	if( P != None )
	{
		// Target is a pawn, so set its Enemy to Self.
		P.Enemy = Self;
	}
	else
	{
		// Target is not a pawn.
	}
}</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>To perform an actor conversion, type the class name followed by the actor expression
you wish to convert, in parenthesis. Such a conversion will either succeed or fail based
on whether the conversion is sensible. In the above example, if your Target is referencing
a Trigger object rather than a pawn, the expression Pawn(Target) will return
&quot;None&quot;, since a Trigger can&#146;t be converted to a Pawn. However, if your
Target is referencing a Brute object, the conversion will successfully return the Brute,
because Brute is a subclass of Pawn.</p>

<p>Thus, actor conversions have two purposes: First, you can use them to see if a certain
actor reference belongs to a certain class. Second, you can use them to convert an actor
reference from one class to a more specific class. Note that these conversions don&#146;t
affect the actor you&#146;re converting at all -- they just enable UnrealScript to treat
the actor reference as if it were a more specific type.</p>

<p>Another example of conversions lies in the Inventory script. Each Inventory actor is
owned by a Pawn, even though its Owner variable can refer to any Actor. So a common theme
in the Inventory code is to cast Owner to a Pawn, for example:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>// Called by engine when destroyed.
function Destroyed()
{
	// Remove from owner's inventory.
	if( Pawn(Owner)!=None )
		Pawn(Owner).DeleteInventory( Self );
}&nbsp;</small></pre>

<p>UnrealScript provides a wide variety of C/C++/Java-style operators for such operations
as adding numbers together, comaring values, and incrementing variables. The complete set
of operators is defined in Object.u, but here is a recap. Here are the standard operators,

<p>The above table lists the operators in order of precedence (with operators of the same
precedence grouped together). When you type in a complex expression like

multiplication has a higher precedence than addition, the expression is evaluated as
&quot;(1*2)+(3*4)&quot;.</p>

<p>The &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; (logical and) and &quot;||&quot; (logical or) operators are
short-circuited: if the result of the expression can be determined solely from the first

<p>ForEach and iterator functions</p>

<p>UnrealScript&#146;s &quot;foreach&quot; command makes it easy to deal with large groups
of actors, for example all of the actors in a level, or all of the actors within a certain
distance of another actor. &quot;foreach&quot; works in conjunction with a special kind of
function called an &quot;iterator&quot; function whose purpose is to iterate through a
list of actors.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example of foreach:</p>
</font>

<pre><small>// Display a list of all lights in the level.
function Something()
{
	local actor A;
&nbsp;
	// Go through all actors in the level.
	log( &quot;Lights:&quot; );
	foreach AllActors( class &#145;Actor&#146;, A )
	{
		if( A.LightType != LT_None )
			log( A );
	}
}</small></pre>
<font size="2">

<p>The first parameter in all &quot;foreach&quot; commands is a constant class, which
specifies what kinds of actors to search. You can use this to limit the search to, for
example, all Pawns only.</p>

<p>The second parameter in all &quot;foreach&quot; commands is a variable which is
assigned an actor on each iteration through the &quot;foreach&quot; loop.</p>

<p>Here are all of the iterator functions which work with &quot;foreach&quot;. 

<ol>
  <b>
  <li>AllActors ( class BaseClass, out actor Actor, optional name MatchTag );</b> Iterates
    through all actors in the level. If you specify an optional MatchTag, only includes actors

    to manually reset a variable to its default value. For example, when the player drops an
    inventory item, the inventory code needs to reset some of the actor&#146;s values to its
    defaults. In UnrealScript, you can access the default variables of a class with the
    &quot;Default.&quot; keyword. For example:</li>
</ul>
</font>

<h3></b></i>Technical notes<b><i></h3>
</i><font size="2">

<p>Garbage collection:</b> All objects and actors in Unreal are garbage-collected using a
tree-following garbage collector similar to that of the Java VM. The Unreal garbage
collector uses the UObject class&#146;s serialization functionality to recursively figure
out which other objects are referenced by each active object. As a result, object need not
be explicitly deleted, because the garbage collector will eventually hunt them down when
they become unreferenced. This approach has the side-effect of latent deletion of
unreferenced objects; however it is far more efficient than reference counting in the case
of infrequent deletion.</p>
<b>

<p>Unreal COM integration:</b> Unreal&#146;s base UObject class derives from IUnknown in
anticipation of making Unreal interoperable with the Component Object Model without
requiring binary changes to objects. However, Unreal is not COM-aware at the moment and
the benefits of integrating Unreal with COM are not yet clear, so this project is on
indefinite hold.</p>
<b>

<p>UnrealScript is bytecode based:</b> UnrealScript code is compiled into a series of
bytecodes similar to p-code or the Java bytecodes. This makes UnrealScript
platform-neutral; this porting the client and server components of Unreal to other
platforms, i.e. the Macintosh or Unix, is straightforward, and all versions can
interoperate easily by executing the same scripts.</p>
<b>

<p>Unreal as a Virtual Machine: </b>The Unreal engine can be regarded as a virtual machine
for 3D gaming in the same way that the Java language and the built-in Java class hierarchy
define a virtual machine for Web page scripting. The Unreal virtual machine is inherently
portable (due to splitting out all platform-dependent code in separate modules) and
expandable (due to the expandable class hierarchy). However, at this time, there are no
plans to document the Unreal VM to the extent necessary for others to create independent
but compatible implementations.</p>
<b>

<p>The UnrealScript compiler is two-pass:</b> Unlike C++, UnrealScript is compiled in two
distinct passes. In the first pass, variable, state and function definitions are parsed
and remembered. In the second pass, the script code is compiled to byte codes. This
enables complex script hierarchies with circular dependencies to be completely compiled
and linked in two passes, without a separate link phase.</p>
<b>

<p>Persistent actor state:</b> It is important to note that in Unreal, because the user
can save the game at any time, the state of all actors, including their script execution
state, can be saved at any time where all actors are at their lowest possible stack level.
This persistence requirement is the reason behind the limitation that latent functions may
only be called from state code: state code executes at the lowest possible stack level,
and thus can be serialized easily. Function code may exist at any stack level, and could
have (for example) C++ intrinsic functions below it on the stack, which is clearly not a
situation which one could save on disk and later restore.</p>
<b>

<p>Unrealfiles:</b> Unrealfiles are Unreal&#146;s native binary file format. Unrealfiles
contain an index, serialized dump of the objects in a particular Unreal package.
Unrealfiles are similar to DLL&#146;s, in that they can contain references to other
objects stored in other Unrealfiles. This approach makes it possible to distribute Unreal
content in predefined &quot;packages&quot; on the Internet, in order to reduce download
time (by never downloading a particular package more than once).</p>
</font>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Why UnrealScript does not support static variables:</strong>
While C++ supports static (per class-process) variables for good reasons true to the
language's low-level roots, and Java support static variables for reasons that appear to
be not well thought out, such variables do not have a place in UnrealScript because of
ambiguities over their scope with respect to serialization, derivation, and multiple
levels: should static variables have &quot;global&quot; semantics, meaning that all static
variables in all active Unreal levels have the same value? Should they be per package?
Should they be per level? If so, how are they serialized -- with the class in its .u file,
or with the level in its .unr file? Are they unique per base class, or do derived versions
of classes have their own values of static variables? In UnrealScript, we sidestep the
problem by not defining static variables as a language feature, and leaving it up to
programmers to manage static-like and global-like variables by creating classes to contain
them and exposing them in actual objects. If you want to have variables that are
accessible per-level, you can create a new class to contain those variables and assure
they are serialized with the level. This way, there is no ambiguity. For examples of
classes that serve this kind of purpose, see LevelInfo and GameInfo.</font></p>

<p>UnrealScript programming strategy</p>
</b></i></font><font size="2">

<p>Here I want to cover a few topics on how to write UnrealScript code effectively, and
take advantage of UnrealScript&#146;s strengths while avoiding the pitfalls. 

<ul>
  <li>UnrealScript is a slow language compared to C/C++. A typical C++ program runs at about
    50 million base language instructions per second, while UnrealScript runs at about 2.5
    million - a 20X performance hit. The programming philosophy behind all of our own script
    writing is this: Write scripts that are almost always idle. In other words, use
    UnrealScript only to handle the &quot;interesting&quot; events that you want to customize,
    not the rote tasks, like basic movement, which Unreal&#146;s physics code can handle for
    you. For example, when writing a projectile script, you typically write a HitWall(),
    Bounce(), and Touch() function describing what to do when key events happen. Thus 95% of
    the time, your projectile script isn&#146;t executing any code, and is just waiting for
    the physics code to notify it of an event. This is inherently very efficient. In our
    typical level, even though UnrealScript is comparably much slower than C++, UnrealScript
    execution time averages 5-10% of CPU time. </li>
  <li>Exploit latent functions (like FinishAnim and Sleep) as much as possible. By basing the
    flow of your script execution on them, you are creating animation-driven or time-driven
    code, which is fairy efficient in UnrealScript. </li>
  <li>Keep an eye on the Unreal log while you&#146;re testing your scripts. The UnrealScript
    runtime often generates useful warnings in the log that notify you of nonfatal problems
    that are occuring. </li>
  <li>Be wary of code that can cause infinite recursion. For example, the &quot;Move&quot;
    command moves the actor and calls your Bump() function if you hit something. Therefore, if
    you use a Move command within a Bump function, you run the risk of recursing forever. Be
    careful. Infinite recursion and infinite looping are the two error conditions which
    UnrealScript doesn&#146;t handle gracefully. </li>
  <li>Spawning and destroying actors are fairly expensive operations on the server side, and
    are even more expensive in network games, because spawns and destroys take up network
    bandwidth. Use them reasonably, and regard actors as &quot;heavy weight&quot; objects. For
    example, do not try to create a particle system by spawning 100 unique actors and sending
    them off on different trajectories using the physics code. That will be sloooow. </li>
  <li>Exploit UnrealScript&#146;s object-oriented capabilities as much as possible. Creating
    new functionality by overriding existing functions and states leads to clean code that is
    easy to modify and easy to integrate with other peoples&#146; work. Avoid using
    traditional C techniques, like doing a switch() statement based on the class of an actor
    or the state, because code like this tends to break as you add new classes and modify
    things.</li>
